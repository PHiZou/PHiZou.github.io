# Daily AI News Poem Generator

_Automatically generated every morning at 8:00 AM EST._

This page showcases a daily vertical video summarizing world events as a short poem, narrated with local TTS and assembled using MoviePy.

Each video is generated by a pipeline I built in Python using:

- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Piper TTS
- MoviePy video assembly
- Cron scheduling

Below are the daily outputs.

Under this header, we will append new video entries daily.
